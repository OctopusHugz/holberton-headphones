# 0x09. Implement a design from scratch

### [0. Read and be familiar with Figma](./README.md)

- Create an account in Figma and open this project and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

### [1. Header](./0-index.html)

- Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

### [2. "What we do..." section](./1-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

### [3. "Our results" section](./2-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

### [4. Contact us](./3-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

### [5. Footer](./4-index.html)

- Copy files from the previous task.

### [6. Replace background image with... code!](./100-index.html)

- In the section “Our results”; without the use of an image file, draw each pentagon using HTML and CSS.

### [7. Let's animate items](./101-index.html)

- From 4-index.html and 4-styles.css, add fun animations to “What we do…” and “Our results” sections items row.
  Either all the time, either when hover.

### [8. And SASS??](./102-styles.scss)

- Take your 101-styles.css file and create a 102-styles.scss that will be the SASS version of it.
